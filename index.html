                Current Junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My main
                interest lies in using my analytical and computational skills to develop innovative solutions for
                real-world problems. I previously interned at Ford Motor company as a Product Development intern,
                working on the 2024 F-150, and will also be interning at Ford as a Software Engineering Intern in their
                robotics and automation department this summer.
                <br> <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing Chess, which I have been playing for 1 year. I am also an Eagle Scout
                and completed a community service project where I built a vegetable garden with a built-in irrigation
                system at a local temple.
                <br> <br>
                Looking ahead, I hope to secure an internship or full-time position as a software engineer at a
                reputable tech company. This would allow me to continue learning and developing my skills while
                contributing to meaningful projects.
